# AI Travel Agent - Phase 1

## Overview

This is a Python-based application that processes customer travel inquiries from text files and generates formatted Excel reports. The system uses a hybrid approach combining machine learning (BERT-based NER) with rule-based pattern matching to extract key information from customer inquiries in multiple languages (English, Hindi, and Hinglish).

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for each processing step
- **Hybrid ML/Rule-based Processing**: Combines BERT NER models with regex patterns for robust entity extraction
- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing of multiple inquiries
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing stages with clear data flow

### Technology Stack
- **Python 3.8+**: Core runtime environment
- **ML Libraries**: Transformers (BERT), spaCy for NLP processing
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation, OpenPyXL for Excel generation
- **Concurrency**: ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing
- **Text Processing**: chardet for encoding detection, regex for pattern matching

## Key Components

### 1. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- Centralized configuration for all application settings
- Processing parameters (timeouts, batch sizes, worker counts)
- ML model configurations and entity mappings
- File paths and directory structures

### 2. Core Processing Pipeline (`pipeline/`)
- **InquiryProcessor**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all processing steps
- Sequential processing: preprocessing → ML extraction → rule-based extraction → fusion → output

### 3. Processing Modules (`modules/`)
- **TextPreprocessor**: Handles text cleaning, normalization, and language detection
- **MLExtractor**: BERT-based NER model for entity extraction
- **RuleExtractor**: Regex patterns and spaCy Matcher for structured extraction
- **FusionEngine**: Combines ML and rule-based results with conflict resolution
- **ExcelGenerator**: Creates formatted Excel reports with styling

### 4. Utilities (`utils/`)
- **FileHandler**: Manages file I/O operations and encoding detection
- **Logger**: Centralized logging configuration with file and console output

### 5. Main Application (`main.py`)
- Entry point that orchestrates the entire workflow
- Handles concurrent processing of multiple inquiries
- Manages directory setup and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **File Ingestion**: Read text files from `inquiries/` directory
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize multilingual text
3. **Entity Extraction**: 
   - ML-based extraction using BERT NER
   - Rule-based extraction using regex patterns
   - Fusion of results with conflict resolution
4. **Concurrent Processing**: Process multiple files in parallel
5. **Excel Generation**: Create formatted reports in `output/` directory

### Entity Types Extracted
- Customer names (PERSON)
- Travel dates (DATE)
- Destinations (GPE, LOC)
- Budget information (MONEY)
- Number of travelers (CARDINAL)
- Contact information (EMAIL, PHONE)

## External Dependencies

### ML Models
- **BERT NER Model**: `dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english`
- **spaCy Model**: `en_core_web_sm` for English text processing
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face pipeline for BERT inference

### Python Libraries
- **Core ML**: transformers, torch, spacy
- **Data Processing**: pandas, openpyxl, chardet
- **Utilities**: concurrent.futures, pathlib, logging

### Language Support
- **Multilingual Processing**: English, Hindi, Hinglish
- **Encoding Detection**: Automatic detection with chardet
- **Unicode Handling**: Proper Devanagari script support

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit Configuration**: Python 3.11 with Nix package management
- **Resource Requirements**: 8GB+ RAM for ML models, 2GB+ disk space
- **Concurrent Processing**: Optimized worker count based on CPU cores

### Production Considerations
- **Model Loading**: Lazy loading of BERT models to reduce startup time
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large text processing batches
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Scalability**: Configurable batch sizes and worker counts

### Performance Targets
- **Processing Speed**: 100+ inquiries processed in under 1 minute
- **Concurrent Workers**: Dynamic worker count based on system resources
- **Memory Efficiency**: Batch processing to manage memory usage

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
